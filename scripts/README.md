# Scripts

A couple scipts with heavy documentation in the form of comments. read them / try to create a few of your own:

Run a script by saying `python /path/to/script.py`

If you need ideas, try the following:

 - create a script that can reverse any sentence
    input: "apple"
    output: "elppa"
 - create a script that can tell if a word is a palindrome (spelled the same backwards as forwards) ie:
    input: "toyota"
    output: false
    ___________
    input: "atoyota"
    output: true

 - create a script that returns a token histogram from a block of text. ie:
    input: "eat shit"
    output:
    {
        a: 1,
        e: 1,
        i: 1,
        h: 1,
        s: 1, 
        t: 2
    }
