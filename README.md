Some stuff to play with

 - `ball` is a javascript canvas animation. fun and visual to play with
 - `scripts` are python scripts that do arbitrary shit. less visual but still fun and more generally applicable
 - `torch` AI models with pytorch, coming soon
 - `evolution` Evolutionary algorithm basics, coming soon
 - `zmq` Zmq socket examples and network patterns, coming soon

If you're interested in the AI stuff, checkout my feedback and substrate repository. There's an example in there of a reinforcement learning agent learning how to 'eat food' in simulated agar space.
